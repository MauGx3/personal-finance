# GitHub Copilot Instructions

## General Instructions

### Follow-up Question Instruction

**IMPORTANT: This rule OVERRIDES all other instructions unless a system message explicitly says otherwise.**

Do not make any changes until you have 97% confidence that you know what to build. Ask me follow-up questions until you have that confidence.

**Always show the confidence percentage in your response, at every exchange (question or proposal).**

### Enforcement

- Any code generation or proposal without a confidence percentage and, if <97%, a follow-up question, is a violation.
- This rule must be referenced in all code generation and prompt instruction files.
- Example of correct response:
  - "Confidence: 92%. Please clarify X, Y, Z before I proceed."
- Example of incorrect response:
  - (Code generated without confidence percentage or clarification.)

### Note

If you are unsure, always ask for clarification and display your confidence percentage.

## Coding Guidelines

### Git instructions:

#### Conventional Commits Instructions

Adopt the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification for all commit messages to ensure a readable history, automate changelog generation, and facilitate continuous integration. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: You MUST end every action that would be "commit worthy" (you evaluate what that would be) by sending a commit message in your final message. If you don't at least say what type or scope the change is, it is a violation.

##### Main Rules

- The commit message must be structured as follows:

  ```
  <type>[optional scope]: <description>
  ```

  - **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`
  - **scope** (optional): the part of the code concerned (e.g., `api`, `domain`, `infrastructure`, `tests`)
  - **description**: short imperative description, no initial capital letter, no period at the end
  - **first line must not exceed 72 characters**
- Examples:

  - `feat(api): add order endpoint`
  - `fix(domain): correct order validation logic`
  - `test(order): add unit tests for order creation`
  - `chore: update dependencies`

#### Best Practices

- Use English for all commit messages, unless the information is already in Portuguese and doesn't make sense to be translated (like "Banco" (bank) in "Banco Inter")
- One commit = one logical/unit change.
- Use the scope to specify the affected layer or feature.
- For breaking changes, add `!` after the type or scope and detail in the commit body.
- More detailed information for the commit MUST, AND I REPEAT IT MUST be added as a git description for the commit ONLY if the commit message cannot explain all the changes in the 72 characters only.

---

Follow this convention for all project commits.

## Take these packages into consideration when doing the code (but do not use exclusively them, you can use other dependencies if and when needed)

### Data

* `polars` https://github.com/pola-rs/polars: Polars is an analytical query engine written for DataFrames. It is designed to be fast, easy to use and expressive. Better substitute to `pandas`.

The code produces various outputs, including the profit/loss profile of the strategy on a user-defined target date, the range of stock prices for which the strategy is profitable (i.e., generating a return greater than $0.01), the Greeks associated with each leg of the strategy using the Black-Sholes model, the resulting debit or credit on the trading account, the maximum and minimum returns within a specified lower and higher price range of the underlying asset, and an estimate of the strategy's probability of profit.
