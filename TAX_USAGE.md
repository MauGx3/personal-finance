## Usage Examples

### Basic Tax Calculation

```python
from personal_finance.tax.services import TaxCalculationService
from personal_finance.tax.models import TaxYear

# Initialize service
tax_service = TaxCalculationService()

# Get tax year
tax_year = TaxYear.objects.get(year=2024)

# Calculate capital gains/losses
capital_gains = tax_service.calculate_capital_gains_losses(user, tax_year)
print(f"Net capital gain/loss: ${capital_gains['totals']['net_capital_gain_loss']}")

# Calculate dividend income
dividends = tax_service.calculate_dividend_income(user, tax_year)
print(f"Total qualified dividends: ${dividends['qualified_dividends']}")
```

### Tax Loss Harvesting Analysis

```python
from personal_finance.tax.services import TaxLossHarvestingService

# Initialize service
loss_service = TaxLossHarvestingService()

# Find opportunities
opportunities = loss_service.identify_loss_harvesting_opportunities(
    user, minimum_loss_threshold=Decimal('250')
)

# Generate recommendations
loss_service.generate_loss_harvesting_recommendations(opportunities)

for opp in opportunities:
    print(f"{opp.position.asset.symbol}: ${opp.potential_loss_amount} loss")
    print(f"  Status: {opp.status}")
    print(f"  Estimated benefit: ${opp.tax_benefit_estimate}")
```

### Tax Report Generation

```python
from personal_finance.tax.report_service import TaxReportService

# Initialize service
report_service = TaxReportService()

# Generate Schedule D
schedule_d = report_service.generate_schedule_d_report(user, tax_year)
print(f"Net capital gain/loss: ${schedule_d.net_capital_gain_loss}")

# Generate all reports
reports = report_service.generate_all_tax_reports(user, tax_year)
for report_type, report in reports.items():
    print(f"{report_type}: {report.get_report_type_display()}")
```

### Tax Optimization

from personal_finance.tax.services import TaxOptimizationService

# Initialize service
optimization_service = TaxOptimizationService()

# Generate recommendations
recommendations = optimization_service.generate_tax_optimization_recommendations(user)

for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"{rec.title}")
    print(f"  Priority: {rec.priority}")
    print(f"  Estimated savings: ${rec.estimated_tax_savings}")
    print(f"  Deadline: {rec.deadline}")
```

# Create tax year with current brackets
tax_year_2024 = TaxYear.objects.create(
    year=2024,
    filing_deadline='2025-04-15',
    standard_deduction_single=13850,
    standard_deduction_married=27700,
    long_term_capital_gains_thresholds={
        '0': {'min': 0, 'max': 44625, 'rate': 0.0},
        '15': {'min': 44626, 'max': 492300, 'rate': 0.15},
        '20': {'min': 492301, 'max': None, 'rate': 0.20}
    },
    short_term_capital_gains_rate=0.37
)
```

## Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Always use Decimal**: Use Decimal type for financial calculations
2. **Validate wash sales**: Check wash sale rules before sales
3. **Track tax lots**: Maintain detailed cost basis records
4. **Regular processing**: Run tax calculations regularly
5. **Error handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling

### For Users

1. **Regular updates**: Keep transaction data current
2. **Review opportunities**: Check loss harvesting regularly
3. **Plan ahead**: Use optimization recommendations
4. **Document decisions**: Keep notes on tax strategies
5. **Consult professionals**: Verify with tax advisors

## Security and Compliance

### Data Protection
- User data isolation and access controls
- Encrypted storage of sensitive financial data
- Audit trails for all tax calculations
- Secure API endpoints with authentication

### Tax Compliance
- Accurate wash sale rule implementation
- Proper short-term vs long-term classification
- Correct dividend type handling
- Standard tax lot accounting methods (FIFO)

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization
- Strategic indexing for tax queries
- Efficient bulk processing operations
- Optimized tax lot management
- Cached calculation results

### Calculation Efficiency
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Incremental tax calculations
- Memory-efficient algorithms
- Progress tracking for long operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing tax lots**: Ensure buy transactions are processed first
2. **Incorrect gains/losses**: Verify transaction data accuracy
3. **Wash sale detection**: Check for related asset purchases
4. **Performance issues**: Use pagination for large datasets

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Verify tax calculations
python manage.py calculate_taxes --user admin --dry-run --verbose

# Check for data inconsistencies
python manage.py shell
>>> from personal_finance.tax.models import TaxLot
>>> lots = TaxLot.objects.filter(remaining_quantity__lt=0)
>>> print(f"Invalid lots: {lots.count()}")

# Review tax lot assignments
>>> from django.db.models import Sum
>>> summary = TaxLot.objects.aggregate(
...     total_cost=Sum('total_cost_basis'),
...     total_remaining=Sum('remaining_quantity')
... )
>>> print(summary)
```

## Integration Examples

### Automated Tax Processing

Set up automated tax processing with periodic tasks:

```python
# In celery tasks
from celery import shared_task

@shared_task
def process_daily_tax_calculations():
    """Process tax calculations for recent transactions."""
    from personal_finance.tax.services import TaxCalculationService
    
    tax_service = TaxCalculationService()
    # Process recent transactions
    # Generate reports if month-end
    # Send notifications for opportunities
```

### Custom Tax Strategies

Extend the system with custom tax strategies:

```python
from personal_finance.tax.services import TaxOptimizationService

class CustomTaxOptimizationService(TaxOptimizationService):
    def generate_custom_recommendations(self, user, portfolio):
        """Generate custom tax recommendations."""
        recommendations = []
        
        # Implement custom logic
        # Add to recommendations list
        
        return recommendations
```

This comprehensive tax reporting and optimization system provides all the tools needed for sophisticated tax management within the personal finance platform!
