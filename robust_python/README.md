## Installation

You can install `robust_python` via [pip](pip-documentation) from PyPI:

```bash
pip install robust_python
```

### Installation for Development

To set up `robust_python` for local development:

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/maugx3/personal_finance.git
    cd robust_python
    ```
2.  Install dependencies using [:term:`uv`](uv-documentation):
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```
3.  Install pre-commit hooks:
    ```bash
    uvx nox -s pre-commit -- install
    ```

This sets up a virtual environment and installs core, development, and quality check dependencies.

## Usage

(This section should explain how to use the generated application. Replace the content below with instructions specific to your project's functionality. If your project is a library, show import examples. If it's a CLI application, show command examples. Link to the full documentation for details.)

### As a Library

```python
# Example usage of your package as a library
# from robust_python import some_function
# result = some_function()
# print(result)
```

### As a Command-Line Application

If your project defines command-line entry points in `pyproject.toml`:

```bash
# Example usage of your CLI application
# robust_python --help
# robust_python do-something --input file.txt
```

For detailed API documentation and CLI command references, see the **[Documentation][documentation]**.

## Development Workflow

This project uses a robust set of tools for development, testing, and quality assurance. All significant automated tasks are run via [:term:`Nox`](nox-documentation), orchestrated by the central `noxfile.py`.

- **Run all checks (lint, typecheck, security):** `uvx nox -s check`
- **Run test suite with coverage:** `uvx nox -s test`
- **Build documentation:** `uvx nox -s docs`
- **Build package:** `uvx nox -s build`
- **See all available tasks:** `uvx nox -l`

Explore the `noxfile.py` and the project documentation for detailed information on the automated workflow.
